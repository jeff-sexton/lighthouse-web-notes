# Incremental coding 👣

![steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/steps.jpg)

---

When programming we want to break down problems into smaller easier to understand steps.

If we can slice bread 🍞, open peanut butter/jam jars🍯, and use a butter knife 🗡 then we can make a PB&J 🥪.

Easier to isolate errors.

🧠 Can refactor/improve code as we go.

---


## DEMO

GOAL:

>Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

---

# Live coding?


![steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/matrix.gif)

Coding doesn't have to look like this.

With lectures at lighthouse labs, instructors will often live code to demonstrate course concepts.

You shouldn't try to code along or replicate the code but instead pay attention to what is happening collaborate and give feedback to the lecturer.

They will ask for suggestions, and can run into errors it can be a collective coding experience.

---

Use live coding as an opportunity to take notes 📔, and ask questions 🙋.

You will not always understand everything a lecturer codes, this is inevitable.
Instead try to leave lecture with a general understanding of what the code was supposed to accomplish and do further research/ activities to better understand the specifics.

# git 💾⌚
![git](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/git.png)

_Repository_: System for tracking changes in source code during software development.

---

- Remembers the history of our code

- Documents changes with commit messages, listing the author of the changes

- Can use a remote git repository to back up our data

- We can undo changes we make

- Makes it easy to collaborate with others on code

- And much more!

# Git Gud

![stage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/gitstage.png)

---

__Init__: initializes a git repository for the current directory/folder.

__Add__: Adds the specified files to the staging area for future commits.

__Commit__: Saves the staged files to the local git repository. (commit often)

__Remote__: Adds a remote repository

__Push__: Updates the remote git repository with any new changes in the local git repository.

---

## Basic git workflow:

```
📂 init -> 📥 add -> 📩 commit -> 📨 push
```

# Back to Coding..

## How Did We?


---

- 🎊 Break your solution into functions as you go

- 👣 Write in small steps (smallest possible executable program)

- 🎽 Lint your code as you go

   - indenting code as you go

- ✀ Avoid copy/pasting anything

- 📥 Commit often

- 📣 console log to understand data

- 🐛 Use node debug with debugger


---

# Debugging 🐛
![bugs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/debugging.png)

Problem solving tips

- Errors are your friend, but you have to try and understand what they are saying and not guess

- Typical week1 research path:  
   1. Google for a question (how do you phrase it?)  
   2. Stackoverflow is first hit, shows an approach, is it valid?  
   3. I've never seen this weird arrow function syntax before that is in the approved answer!?!🤬  What does that mean? How do I interpret that?  

---

__Tips__
- What type of error is it 📝 parsing/run-time error? (error message) or a 🤖 logical error? (code runs but doesn't do what it is supposed to)  
1. 🤖 For logical errors use console.logs, and debugger to understand why?  
   - Do a dry run of the code in your head
2. 📝 For parsing errors look for syntax errors, and do some research.  
   - Practice reading error messages, before copy pasting into google.  
   - Go to MDN to check for other examples.  
   - Experiment with how you are googling questions  
       - Have you included relevant information?  
       - If a mentor googles for problem solving pay attention to what they search.  
- Evaluate if you need mentor support?

## Mentor Reminders

![mentor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week1/day2/assets/mentor.jpg)

---

- ⏳ 15m rule  
- ❌ don't just say "it's not working" to a mentor; explain first what you're trying to solve and where you are stuck. Even asking for help properly is a skill that will take some time for you to acquire, we don't expect it to be perfect on D2 but we expect you to work towards improving it.  
- 💻 Code reviews are important

---

# Tools 🔧

- JS [Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)  
- Node Debugger

## Lotide 🌊

Today you will be continuing with Lotide but not all the assignments will have to do with lotide.

# Activities

- Non git remote dry run with paper  
- PBJ coding
