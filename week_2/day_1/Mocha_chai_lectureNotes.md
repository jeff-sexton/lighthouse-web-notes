# Testing Review

You have been writing assertions since early in the Bootcamp, what is the purpose of writing tests?

What are some benefits?

- It gives us an idea of where we are going wrong or what we have to do.
- You have a way of knowing that your code is in continuing good working order
- Can check for final behavior as well as the behavior of individual parts
- Know the expected output (what your code should do)
- Forces you to think about the expected output before you code
- Lets us know early on if something is not working

What are Assertions?

- different scenarios that we can use to test all of our code, maybe things that don't initially think of
- comparison between an actual value and the expected value. 


# TDD

![TDD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week2/day1/assets/TDD.png)

Stands for Test-Driven Development. 

It is the process of writing tests for requirements/features before you write the code for that requirement/feature. 

Red Green Cyle

0. Decide/Recieve project requirements

1. Write a test for a requirement that fails (RED)  
2. Write code until that test passes (GREEN)  
  - Refactor code (RED/GREEN)  
3. Repeat  

These short development cycles allow for continual feedback.

Code that is not for a requirement/test is not written. 

## Modules?

![modules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week2/day1/assets/modules.png)

- A file(code) that can be used in another file(code).  
- A module(file) has it's own scope  
- You need to specify what will be exported from the file to be used in other files.  

### CommonJS

Module standard for JS

Bring in modules with

```js
const thing = require('filename');
```

Export things from a file

```js
module.exports = {
  thing: 1
}
```

# NPM  
![npm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/lectures/master/week2/day1/assets/npm.png)

Node Package Manager.  
- makes it easy to install and manage node modules  
- package.json file  
- manages dependencies  

An ecosystem of modules or packages that we can bring into our project to use. 
We benefit from the code that others have written. Don't reinvent the wheel. 

# Mocha

Mocha is a testing framework for the javascript node enviornment.   
Mocha is a test runner.   
  - Organizes tests  
    - has a specific folder that it looks in to find tests  
  - executes tests  
    - provides clear feedback on the state of tests  
Mocha is a node module.  
Mocha does not have its own assertions.   

Gives us ways of describing our tests so that they are clear and readable to the test runner. 

__describe__ gives context for a group of test cases. (often a function)  
__it__ describes a specific test case that can pass or fail. 


# Chai 

- Chai is an assertion library.   
- Chai is a node module.  
- We will use Chai with Mocha for our assertions.   
  - Helps us verify that things are correct.   
    - less if statements  

Given a value x we want it to look like "y"

Chai provides gives us different assertion flavors/styles. What you use is a matter of preference. (yours and your teams)

1. Assert style  
```js   
var assert = require('chai').assert;
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

assert.isArray(numbers, 'is array of numbers');
assert.include(numbers, 2, 'array contains 2');
assert.lengthOf(numbers, 5, 'array contains 5 numbers');
```
2. Expect style  
```js  
var expect = require('chai').expect;
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

expect(numbers).to.be.an('array').that.includes(2);
expect(numbers).to.have.lengthOf(5);
```
3. Should style  
```js 
var should = require('chai').should();
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.should.be.an('array').that.includes(2);
numbers.should.have.lengthOf(5);
```
